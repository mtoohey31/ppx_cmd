# ppx_cmd

## TODO

- [ ] Multiple long flags.
- [ ] Negatable boolean flags.
- [ ] Version flags (with version from build system if possible).
- [ ] Subcommands.
- [ ] Add documentation to README.
- [ ] Avoid repeating expressions in output (for value bindings that use others, and helpers that are repeated).
