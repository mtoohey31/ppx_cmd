# ppx_cmd

Declarative command line parsing for OCaml with `@@deriving`.

## TODO

- [ ] Help flags (with binary name from build system if possible).
- [ ] Version flags (with version from build system if possible).
- [ ] Subcommands.
- [ ] Add documentation to README.
- [ ] Avoid repeating expressions in output (for value bindings that use others, and helpers that are repeated).
